Answer to Question 1 
Biological robustness refers to the ability of an organism to maintain its function and survival in the face of changes in its environment. This includes resistance to disease and stress, as well as the ability to adapt to new conditions. On the other hand, fragility refers to the opposite - an organism's susceptibility to harm and failure in response to environmental changes.

One example of robustness in biology is the immune system's ability to fight off pathogens. The immune system is able to recognize and respond to a wide variety of pathogens, and can adapt to new threats through a process called immunological memory. This allows organisms to survive and thrive despite exposure to a constantly changing environment filled with potential pathogens.

In contrast, an example of fragility in biology is the susceptibility of certain species to extinction. For example, the extinction of the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) is a well-known example of fragility. Once the most abundant bird in North America, their populations rapidly declined due to hunting and habitat destruction, leading to their extinction in the wild in the early 20th century.

Biological robustness is an integral part of survival because it allows organisms to adapt and thrive in a constantly changing environment. It enables them to respond to new threats and changes in their environment, such as changes in temperature, humidity, or the emergence of new pathogens. This ability to adapt and survive is essential for the continuation of a species and the maintenance of biodiversity.

Fragility, on the other hand, can have severe consequences, such as extinction or population decline. To avoid fragility, it is important to understand the specific factors that contribute to it in a given species or ecosystem. For example, understanding and mitigating the impact of human activities, such as hunting and habitat destruction, can help prevent extinction. Additionally, preserving genetic diversity through conservation efforts can increase the robustness of a population.

Overall, biological robustness and fragility are important concepts in understanding the survival and adaptation of organisms and populations. Robustness enables organisms to adapt and survive in a constantly changing environment, while fragility can lead to extinction or population decline. To avoid fragility, it is important to understand and mitigate the specific factors that contribute to it in a given species or ecosystem.
